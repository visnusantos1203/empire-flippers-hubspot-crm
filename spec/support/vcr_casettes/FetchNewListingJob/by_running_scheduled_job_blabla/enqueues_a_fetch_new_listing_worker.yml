        2020 in the beauty niche. The included Amazon Seller Central account is a
        part of Amazon Brand Registry and features 17 SKUs related to hair and relaxation.
        The products have strong reviews, with the top SKU rated at 4.5 stars across
        7000+ reviews and ranked overall within the top 10 products in its category.
        The products are popular holiday gifts and see strong sales towards the end
        of the year.\n\nThis business sells in the Amazon North American and Brazilian
        marketplaces and the top five SKUs account for 89% of total sales. There are
        three suppliers, all located in China. There are also two logistics partners
        located in China, who manage the shipping of inventory. The Seller estimates
        70% of inventory is shipped directly to Amazon fulfillment centers and 30%
        is sent to a 3PL.\n\nThe business has two partners who spend a total of 40
        hours per week on the business primarily performing inventory management and
        planning, providing customer service, monitoring customer feedback, performing
        business development, overseeing operations, marketing, product development,
        and accounting.\n\nIncluded with this business are four trademarks, a YouTube
        account with ~1200+ subscribers, and an Instagram account with 500+ followers.\n\nOpportunities
        for growth include adding products within the brand line and launching the
        brand on Walmart. \n\n*This business sells the same products under three different
        Amazon Seller Central accounts to resolve inventory limits. Accounts are under
        different registration names and account info. Their brand has authorized
        these three accounts to sell all products. One of these accounts was unprofitable,
        so it was excluded from the valuation. The other account makes up 10% of net
        income. More information will be provided to Unlockers who schedule a call
        with the Seller.","assets_included":["Primary Amazon Seller Central account
